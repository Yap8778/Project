# 💳 **Credit Card Validation System**

## 📖 **Project Overview**
This project is a credit card validation and processing system developed in Java, complemented by an interactive web interface.  
It is designed for learning Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming concepts, and basic web development.

---

## 🖥 **Java Component**
- 📂 Step1.java / Step2.java – Handle data input, format checking, card type detection, and Luhn algorithm validation.
- 🧪 CreditCardTesting.java – Main testing class that verifies the credit card number based on predefined rules.
- 🧩 Modular Design – Easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

---

## 🌐 **Web Component**
Files: `Webpage.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`  
Theme: 🟩 Hacker-style Matrix UI

### Features
1. ✍ Manual Input – Automatically formats card number with `/` every four digits.
2. 🖼 Image Upload *(🚧 Not fully functional – currently simulating OCR extraction)*  
   - Drag & Drop or Click to Upload card image.  
   - Randomly simulates extracted numbers for demo purposes.  
   - Future updates can integrate real OCR recognition.

---

## 🔍 **Output**
- 💳 Card Type Detection – Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Unknown.
- ✅ Validation Status – Shows whether the card number is valid (based on Luhn algorithm).
- ⚡ Real-Time Display – Results update instantly with smooth animations.

---

## 📌 **Future Improvements**
- 🔹 Implement real OCR for Image Upload feature.
- 🔹 Add more card type recognitions (e.g., Discover, JCB).
- 🔹 Enhance UI responsiveness for mobile devices.
